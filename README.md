# VISUAL BOOK OF C

This is a new project in making by The PotHoles

*Aim*: Make studies easier.

As rightly said by **Alfred Mercier**:
> What we learn with pleasure, we never forgot.

In today's world, especially regarding the education system of many countries, including India, we all tend to always approach the marks oriented way of learning. This not only limits our learning, but puts extra pressure on us. Being average as well, we are never appreciated and always looked down upon and compared with those who are. 

But we should see the facts first. It is because of the kind of education that we are getting.

So visual books would be a way to make learning easier and enjoyable.
